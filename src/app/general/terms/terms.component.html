As part of the checkout process, or on receipt of our Order confirmation, the Customer can check its order and correct any errors. The Supplier will send an Order acknowledgement, detailing the products the Customer has ordered. It is the Customer&acute;s responsibility to ensure that the terms of the Order and any relevant Specification are complete and accurate.<br>
2.3  The Supplier&acute;s acceptance of an Order takes place when Goods are despatched. At this point the purchase contract will be made even if the Customer&acute;s payment has been processed immediately, unless the Customer is notified that their Order is not accepted or it is cancelled.<br>
2.4  The Supplier may refuse to accept an Order:<br>
(a) where the Goods ordered are not available;<br>

(c) if there has been a pricing or product description error; or<br>
(d) if the Customer does not meet any relevant eligibility criteria, including, but not limited to, where the Customer makes a declaration that they are a consumer, when in fact they are a business.<br>
2.5  The Contract constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. The Customer acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of the Supplier which is not set out in the Contract. Any advertising by the Supplier and any descriptions or illustrations contained on the Supplier's website are published for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of the Goods described in them.

Please allow extra time for deliveries to [the Scottish Highlands and Islands or to those postcodes set out on the website.<br>

(b) shall have no liability for late delivery.<br>
