        <p>Ah, the classic "contact us" page.  
          About as uninviting as a wet weekend somewhere very uninviting.           
        </p>
        <p>
            Seriously though, please do contact us.  We're always looking for an excuse to talk about just about anything, but especially anything we can do to help.
            You'll see more and more posts going on here and you'll see that we're not just passionate about keeping people warm for less, but also about making smart choices.

            We've walked the walk on a lot of it too - 4kW solar systems, 10,000 miles a year in an electric car, vehicle-to-grid, monitored oil supply, energy monitors and smart meters... the list goes on.  We're currently in the depths of determining a pragmatic (and cost effective) way of using an air source heat pump to replace an aging boiler in a 30 year old house - watch this space.
            So if you want to know more about anything from oil tank regulations to battery storage systems please drop us an email or give us a call - we're always happy to help.
