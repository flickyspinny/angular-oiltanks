      <h2>The short story... </h2>
      <p>
        SmartNow was started by me, Ian Ballantyne, in Australia in 2009.  Back then energy prices were rising from very low levels, the jobs market was a bit sticky and people were really struggling with paying the enormous power bills that come from running large inefficient houses.

        I had just quit my role at Telstra when a friend introducted me to an inexpensive energy monitor produced by a UK company.  I quickly realised that this was what Australians needed to get their bills under control and to make smart decisions about how to invest in solar panels to put on their rooftops.  From 2009-2018 we introduced over 100,000 energy monitors to Australia, saving Australians millions of dollars and preventing around a million tonnes of carbon dioxide from being emitted.

        Having moved back to the UK, SmartNow continued with the aim of helping people reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.  In 30 years time, very few households will be using fossil fuels to heat their homes and the long and difficult transition must start somewhere.  At the same point, the aim is not to demonise those of us that don't live in a zero-emission PassivHaus.  I use oil and gas and diesel and the aim here is to support those of us who do use fossil fuuels whilst providing sensible, practical solutions for those who want to reduce their usage.
